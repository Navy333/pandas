ðŸ§  Project Summary
This project analyzes a car dataset using the Pandas library in Python, exploring various factors like engine size, fuel efficiency, and pricing. It provides insights into car types, origins, and performance metrics across different models.

 Commands Used in the Project

    import pandas as pd â€“ To import the Pandas library

    pd.read_csv() â€“ To read the CSV file into a DataFrame

    head() â€“ Displays the first 5 rows of the dataset

    shape â€“ Returns the number of rows and columns

    df.isnull().sum() â€“ Identifies missing values in each column

    fillna() â€“ Fills missing values with a specified value (like mean)

    value_counts() â€“ Shows unique values and their counts in a column

    isin() â€“ Filters records containing specific values

    apply() â€“ Applies a function along any axis of the DataFrame

ðŸ“Œ Questions & Instructions Solved

Q1: Data Cleaning
Find all Null values and fill them with the mean of their respective columns using fillna(df.mean()).

Q2: Based on Value Counts
 Display the different types of car manufacturers (Make) and their count using df['Make'].value_counts().

Q3: Filtering Records
 Show all records where Origin is either 'Asia' or 'Europe' using df[df['Origin'].isin(['Asia', 'Europe'])].

Q4: Removing Unwanted Records
 Remove rows where Weight is above 4000 using df = df[df['Weight'] <= 4000].

Q5: Applying Function
 Increase all values in the MPG_City column by 3 using df['MPG_City'] = df['MPG_City'].apply(lambda x: x + 3).
