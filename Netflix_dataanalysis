Netflix Data Analytics Project using Python & Pandas
Welcome to my Netflix Data Analytics project! In this analysis, I explored Netflix's dataset using Python and powerful libraries like Pandas to uncover valuable insights related to content and business decisions.

üìå Project Overview
This project highlights how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary goal is to extract meaningful trends and solve practical business questions based on Netflix's content catalog.

üîç Key Questions Answered

Here are some of the core business and content-related questions addressed in the analysis:

     What is the show ID and director of House of Cards?
