📊 Key Operations Performed

    Data Importing:

        Loaded the dataset using pandas.read_csv() for analysis in Jupyter Notebook.

    Initial Data Exploration:

        Used .head() to preview the dataset.

        Checked dataset dimensions using .shape.

    Missing Value Handling:

        Identified missing/null values using df.isnull().sum().

        Replaced null values in numeric columns with their column-wise mean using fillna().

    Value Counts:

        Analyzed the frequency of car 'Make' types using value_counts() to understand brand distribution.

    Data Filtering:

        Used isin() to filter records where the 'Origin' is either Asia or Europe.

    Data Cleaning:

        Removed all records with Weight > 4000 lbs to eliminate outliers using conditional filtering.

    Column-wise Transformation:

        Increased values in the 'MPG_City' column by 3 using the apply() function to simulate an improvement in fuel efficiency.
