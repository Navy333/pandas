 Police Traffic Stop Data Analysis with Pandas
📌 Description

This project involves exploratory data analysis and preprocessing on a police traffic stop dataset using the Pandas library. The objective is to clean the data, extract insights, and perform group-based and categorical analysis to uncover patterns related to violations, driver demographics, and stop durations.

📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information on traffic stops, including:

    Date and time of stop

    Driver demographics (gender, race, age)

    Violation type

    Search and arrest status

    Stop duration

    Drug-related information

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Tasks

    Missing Values:

        Removed columns with entirely null values using .drop().

    Filtering and Aggregation:

        Used value_counts() to determine whether men or women were stopped more for speeding.

        Analyzed who is more likely to be searched during a stop, grouped by gender using .groupby().

    Data Mapping & Transformation:

        Converted categorical stop_duration values into numeric estimates using .map().

        Calculated the mean stop duration after conversion.

    Grouped Statistical Summaries:

        Compared age distributions across different violations using groupby().describe() for statistical insights.
 Outcomes

    Cleaned and structured the dataset for meaningful analysis.

    Found that men were stopped more for speeding.

    Observed that search likelihood varied by gender.

    Calculated average stop durations by mapping descriptive durations to numeric.

    Provided violation-wise age distribution using grouped summary statistics.
